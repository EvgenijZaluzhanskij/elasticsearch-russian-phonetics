== Configuration

=== Scenario

In this benchmark each phonetic encoder instance consumes 3 different data sets:

. Dictionary of Russian names
+
Contains Russian surnames in uppercase.
+
Data sample:
+
[source,intent=0]
----
АМБРОШКИНА
АМБРУМОВА
АМБРУСЕВИЧ
----
+
Total: *254755* names
. Dictionary of Russian orthography
+
Contains russian words in lowercase followed by a comment.
This dictionary is based on "Russian Spelling Dictionary" by Prof. V. Lopatin. Hash symbol and text after it is ignored.
+
Data sample:
+
[source,intent=0]
----
бог с тобой#б`ог с тоб`ой%б`ог с тоб`ой (в`ами) (выражение несогласия)
бога ради#б`ога р`ади%б`ога р`ади (пожалуйста, очень прошу)
богаделенка#богад`еленка%богад`еленка, -и, р. мн. -нок
----
+
Total: *172899* words
. Dictionary of Russian morphology
+
Contains 173975 unique russian words and their morphological forms (more than 2M in total).
This dictionary is based on link:https://code.google.com/archive/p/hunspell-ru/[hunspell-ru].
+
Data sample:
+
[source,intent=0]
----
Айвазовскими
Айвазовских
Айвазовского
----
+
Total: *2380519* words

For each pair of encoder instance and supplied dictionary the following is taken into account:

* number of generated phonetic codes
* max and mean numbers of words sharing the same code

Soundex, Metaphone and Beider-Morse are available in link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/current/analysis-phonetic.html[Elasticsearch Phonetic Analysis Plugin].
Beider-Morse is the only out-of-the-box option with Russian language support.
It was designed to handle Russian words written in Cyrillic letters via `*cyrillic*` and Russian transliterated into English letters via `*russian*` languageset option value.
For the transliteration of Russian into English letters transliterating adapter is used footnoteref:[translitGost, Letters mappings used in transliterating adapter are based on link:http://gostrf.com/normadata/1/4294816/4294816248.pdf[GOST 7.79-2000 System of standards on information, librarianship and publishing. Rules of transliteration of Cyrillic script by Latin alphabet].].

[WARNING]
====

Both Metaphone and Soundex were designed to work with English language and are therefore not suited for Russian.
Since the purpose of this benchmark is to measure some basic characteristics of different Russian vocabularies distribution across
generated phonetic codes, before supplying russian word to those encoders transliterating adapter is used
to transliterate Russian into English letters footnoteref:[translitGost]
footnote:[According to google search results (link:https://htmlweb.ru/php/example/soundex.php[link1],
link:https://phpclub.ru/talk/threads/%D0%A0%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-metaphone-%D0%B8-soundex.53056/[link2],

link:http://forum.aeroion.ru/topic443.html[link5],
link:https://infostart.ru/public/442217/[link6] etc.)
looks like it is a common practice to use either Metaphone or Soundex to encode transliterated Russian words and
this is the only reason why both of them were included in this benchmark.].

=== Reproduction
This project includes source code for reproducing the results of this benchmark. You can run it with the following command:

[source,intent=0]
----
./gradlew benchmark:run -Ptype='distribution'
----

This command will create data files under the `benchmark/assets` directory. You can use `gnuplot` to generate the plots.

In order to install `gnuplot` on MacOS use the following:

[source,intent=0]
----
brew install gnuplot --with-cairo
----

Distribution plots can be generated with the following command running inside a directory which contains data files:

[source,intent=0]
----
gnuplot dictionary.plot
----

All scripts required for plot generation are located under the `benchmark/assets` directory.

== Benchmark Results

=== Summary

* Soundex gives the worst distribution for all supplied dictionaries. This algorithm has limited scale by design.
Single english letter in uppercase followed by three digits having their values in [1,6] should give about 6K (28*6^3) as
a maximum possible number of unique codes. It won't scale with growing data set and consequently will provide more
irrelevant matches (also known as “false positives”) in search results.
* Russian phonetic encoder gives better distribution for all data sets compared to similar configured Metaphone at the same time showing better results
in {url-throughput-benchmark}[throughput] and {url-misspellings-benchmark}[misspellings and typos matching] benchmarks.
* Russian phonetic encoder with enabled stemmer can accurately handle russian morphology by encoding base (or root) form of the supplied word.
This ability comes with some throughput penalties but is still 20X faster than Beider-Morse. Please see {url-throughput-benchmark}[throughput] benchmark.
* BMRussian gives slightly more fuzziness compared to BMCyrillic. This fact can also be observed in {url-misspellings-benchmark}[misspellings and typos matching] benchmark.
* Algorithms with parametrized max code length give manual control over the distribution.
